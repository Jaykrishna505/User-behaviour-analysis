# User-behaviour-analysis
Here, The analysis of the user behaviour is done by integrating the analytics into our application.
Firstly,I hosted a website and then collected the users data from google analytics.User data is nothing but the web page each user is referring to, and frequency of a user to website,etc.
Next, I manupulated the data and converted it as 'dataset.csv' such that it can be used for data visualization.
Then I used machine learning algorithm to visualize the collected data.The implementation of this algorithm is clearly shown in 'ipynb' file.
The main use of this is any improvements that are required to the website can be known easily, and the necessary action could be taken accordingly.
